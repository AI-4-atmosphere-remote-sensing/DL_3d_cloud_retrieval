# Machine Learning for 3D Cloud Retrievals
In this GitHub repositary, you will find information on how to preprocess the raw data, how to install required packages, all the deep learning models, how to train and test the models, and how to evaluate the test results quantitively and through visualization. Please check out each folder for details.
